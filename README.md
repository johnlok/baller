baller
======

A project by John Lok. A game which uses the accelerometer in mobile devices to control a ball on the screen.

# Preface

This game was inspired by a talk by the one and only Bret Victor, one called ["Stop Drawing Dead Fish"](https://vimeo.com/64895205).

In this project I wanted to explore the computer as a medium for art. Interactivity and computer "behaviour" are two of the main foci for this project.

Intuitiveness guides the design and is another aim of this project. I try to use textual cues as little as possible, instead prompting the user to perform certain actions by visual and tactile cues.

#Tools

In this project I used a HTML5 game framework called [Phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser). The game is written in javascript and makes liberal use of sprites. Depending on the client, Phaser chooses WebGL or Canvas to render the game.

#How to Play

You can view the latest stable version [here](http://johnlok.me/baller). You can also clone the repo and host it locally yourself.
